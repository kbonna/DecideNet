# ðŸ’» Code for DecideNet neuroimaging project

This repository contains code required to reproduce results from my Doctoral project "DecideNet." This project is dedicated to examining and describing functional network reconfiguration during prediction error processing. The analysis is focused on three perspectives: (1) behavioral analysis using the Bayesian modeling approach, (2) activation analysis using model-based fMRI approach, and (3) connectivity analysis using beta-series correlation approach. The analysis is conducted using open-source Python packages for neuroimaging like `nilearn` and `nibabel` and custom Python code.
